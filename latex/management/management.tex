\section{Time Management}
Throughout this project I made use of backup repositories such as:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
\item Dropbox = to store files related to this project, and to be able to access them from any type of station at any moment.
\item Google Drive = to store and share (to selected users) project hardware and software advancements (images and videos).
\item University of Southampton GitLab = to retain a version-control of all the written code.
\end{itemize}

Appendix A provides a wealth of project management tools which have been used throughout this project:

\begin{enumerate}

\item A Gantt Chart of the actual time-schedule.
\item A Risk Assessment Matrix to display all the possible risks associated with this project.
\item A Work Breakdown Structure to show in a tree-like representation the identified main tasks of this project. 
\end{enumerate}

A Hardware Costs report of the project can be found in Appendix D.
