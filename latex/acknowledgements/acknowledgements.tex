I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Srinandan Dasmahapatra, for giving me the opportunity to do this project. This experience enabled me broaden my knowledge on a variety of topics and skills which will play a crucial role in my upcoming career. \\

Finally, I express my gratitude to my second examiner, Adriane Chapman, for her support throughout the project.
