## About This Branch

This branch contains any additional material which has been used in order to complete this project such as:

- Predictive Power Score (PPS) Analysis
- Coronavirus Time Series analysis using Vector Autoregression 

## About The Project

Interactive Epidemics Modelling dashboard created using Streamlit and deployed on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 Linux Instance. In this dashboard, has been used COVID-19 as example case study (in order to provide a practical demonstration) but by changing the modelling parameters (eg. SIR model), parts of this dashboard toolkit can be used also to model many other types of epidemics in general.

This dashboard is currently available live at [this link.](http://3.22.240.181:8501)

## Getting Started

This dashboard was created using `Python 3.6`. To run the code locally, start by installing PyTorch as per the [docs](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Then run in terminal the commands below:

```bash
# Clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/pierpaolo28/Epidemics-Modelling.git
cd Epidemics-Modelling

# (Windows Optional) Create a new Python environment and activate it.
python -m venv .env
.env\Scripts\activate

# (Ubuntu Optional) Create a new Python environment and activate it.
python3 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate

# Install the dependencies.
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run dashboard in localhost (a web-broswer page is automatically going to be opened)
streamlit run src/main.py
```
